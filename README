= rake_commit_tasks

This plugin contains a set of rake tasks for checking your project into subversion.  The most important is:

  rake commit

which:

  1. Add new files to subversion
  2. Delete missing files from subversion
  3. svn update
  4. Run the default rake task (which should run your tests)
  5. Displays svn status
  6. Check cruisecontrol.rb to see if the build is passing
  7. Prompt to check in


The first version started with the code posted at Jay Field's Blog: http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-rake-commit.html
Improvements have been added in from several more projects.
